Categories and Frameworks of Cross Platform Development
In todays world, application development for smart devices is an evolving
field with great economic and scientific interest [6]. Cross platform is a wide
area of development and according to Spyros Xanthopouls and Stelios
Xinnogalas’ paper [6], it has split into four main categories: Interpreted
applications, hybrid applications, generated applications and web
applications. Each category containing its own framework. The reason for
this is that the user experience for each framework creates a certain level of
native look and feel for an application against the actual operating system;
running generated applications achieves the highest native look because it’s
compiled in the OS’ native language. Web applications have the lowest native
look and feel since they are trying to target all markets using web
technologies (HTML5, CSS, JS). There are various frameworks emerging, to
name a few according to Oliver Le Goaer and Sacha Waltham’s paper [7]:
Rhodes, LiveCode, PhoneGap, Titanium, Tabris, Neomades XMLVM, Canappi,
APPlause, MoSync SDK, Codename One and Marmalade SDK. Few are more
matured then others and some well supported frameworks are Titanium and
PhoneGap. The problem that Cross-Platform is trying to solve is well
described in paper [9] and it indicates as follows:
3
“A mobile application may require to be developed several times,
one for each supported platform, thus dramatically increasing
the required time and skills for developers, and finally, the cost
of production. A solution is represented by Framework for cross
platform development.”
4. Interpreted Applications
These applications are interpreted natively to a platform that it’s running
on, so if it’s running on Android it will be interpreted in Java and if running
on iOS it will be Objective-C, thus creating a one hundred percent native look
and feel in the application. Other benefits include being efficient and running
smoothly; since the app is interpreted natively. One of the new frameworks
for interpreted applications is MD 2[13]. One of the more mature frameworks
would be Titanium which is discussed in more detail below.
4.1. Titanium
One of its most valuable features is that is is open source and has been in
development since 2006. It was released in 2008 by the Appcelerator
company and is a commercially supported product with its source code
released under the Apache 2 license [8]. It can be installed on multiple
operating systems including Windows, Macintosh and Linux. It allows the
creation of Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry OS and Tizen apps
from a single code base. It’s based on the MVC pattern (Model View
Controller) so it’s a loosely coupled stable design. Only one JavaScript
language is now required to develop with this framework; this makes it easy
to learn and powerful, you can program all three aspects of your application:
Model, View and Controller in just one language and with the new JavaScript
ECMAScript standard 6 coming out this should make it even more robust. It
allows the use of Cloud (Server) services as a ready to use mobile backend.
When the Titanium application is compiled the engine processes the
JavaScript and builds the appropriate native application for the specific
platforms (iOS uses Objective-C, Android uses Java) thus ensuring a native
look and feel for the application. One of the downsides is that support is
limited on iOS and Android [9]. The advantage of this framework is the ability
to compile the application with the native APIs; it provides a wider set of
native device functionalities that web applications cannot provide [10].

5. Hybrid Applications
Hybrid applications are primarily built using HTML5, they behave like a
website. The way they work is that they have a container within the target
platform, named UIWebView in iOS and WebView in Android; this allows
them to use phone features such as the accelerometer, GPS and camera.
These new capabilities were able to be implemented with the advent of
HTML5. The user interface is not generated natively as previous seen in
interpreted applications, so technology like jQueryMobile and Sencha Touch
[12] are used to achieve native effect but they are not one hundred per cent
native. One of the more popular frameworks is PhoneGap which is based on
top of Cordova, described in more detail below.
5.1. PhoneGap
PhoneGap which is based on top of Apache Cordova was created by a
company Nitoby and is supported by Adobe Systems; it is open source. The
programmer needs to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop
applications using this framework. PhoneGap allows deployments to many
different platforms including Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry,
WebOS Symbian and Bada [11]. PhoneGap is a hybrid application because it’s
not pure HTML/JavaScript. PhoneGap has a bridge between target platforms
such as Android, iOS and Windows Phone which connects the JavaScript API
to the target platform device and allows developers to use such features as
the camera, accelerometer, network, storage and others. The place where
this framework is lacking is that the developer has to create his own style
sheets to make the application feel native to its target platform, there are
tools available for that such as: JQuery Mobile and Sencha Touch [12].
5.2. Ionic
Another hugely successful framework is the Ionic Framework. It is also
based on top of Apache Cordova. Cordova deals with the low level hardware
hooks allowing Ionic to use various hardware features on a device, such as
the accelerometer, gps and camera.
Ionic was created by Drifty Co and is an open source framework released
in 2013, it is based on AngularJS and is open source under the MIT license.
Ionic deals mostly with the visual representation of the application, you
develop the application once and you can then compile it to either iOS or
Android and it keeps the native look and feel. There are many widgets
available via Ionics library in order to achieve the same standard as native
5
apps. You would not be able to discern many Ionic apps against the native
ones. They also include services for analytics and push notifications
All you need to know in order to develop Ionic applications is CSS, HTML5,
and JavaScript. Applications are than distributed to app stores such as
Android and iOS. Ionic requires NPM (node package manager) in order to
install various plugins. Ionic seems to be one of the most popular cross
platform development frameworks for mobile at the moment.
6. Generated Applications
These applications are compiled natively, for that reason they achieve
high performance and generate a native user interface. One of the
frameworks used is Applause [14]. Applause is open source and is based on
Xtext but not much development has been done on the framework [13].
Applause is explained in more detail down below.
6.1. Applause
Applause is based on model driven software development (MDSD). It
includes tools to translate programming languages. It uses cross-compilers
(XMLVN) [15] and transforms Android applications in Java. Applause is
under EPL license which integrates with Eclipse and IDE support. There was
very little information available on Applause, there is currently only one
GitHub link [14].
7. Web Applications
Web applications are browser-based applications running in a browser
using HTML5. WebHooks allow developers to access the hardware on a
phone, this was unavailable before HTML5 [16], also it allows other features
such as web storage, indexed database APIs, file APIs, web SQL Databases and
Offline Web GeoLocations [16]. This makes web applications more mobile
friendly and compatible and allows them to use the full range of phone
features. They do not require installation or any upgrades as it contains a one
to many relationship (one server, many clients) so any updates are done on
the server side and all clients get updated, but the network is required at all
times in order to access the application. It lacks the native look and feel of
target platforms such as Android, iOS or Windows Phone, altough there are
many tools out there trying to solve the problem by simulating a native look
such as Xui, JQyeryMobile, Sencha Touch, JQTouch and WebApp.net. Some
6
frameworks developing web applications include AngularJS, Ruby on Rails,
Django and Drupal. AngularJS is explained in more detail down below.
7.1. AngularJS
It was developed by Misko Hevery in 2009 at Brath Tech LLC. It is now an
open source framework mainly used for developing single page applications
(SPA) it has become widely well known and is the top choice for many
developers for creating dynamic html pages. In order to be able to program
in AngularJS you have to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is maintained by
Google and the developer-community; it is under MIT license [17]. It uses
data binding which means you can attach controllers to certain parts of the
page as well as taking advantage of the MVC (Model, View, Controller)
pattern, creating a loosely coupled design to separate the three components
of the web application so that they all are independent to one another; one of
them can be changed without impacting the others and you can swap and
change components. If an application contains more than one page it can use
Client side routing in order to dynamically switch content without refreshing
the page [18]. The Batarang plugin was built by Google in 2012 to improve
the debugging of web applications built using AngularJS. It is also used with
another three popular technologies known collectively as the MEAN Stack
(MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and NodeJS). MongoDB is cross platform
oriented database, it uses a JavaScript/JSON style syntax; it is open source.
Express is a server framework that is used for building single page web
applications and is expandable via plugins. NodeJS is cross platform runtime
environment for server side applications, it’s open source. As we can see all
the technologies used in the MEAN stack are open source suggesting the
reason for its huge community and popularity.
8. User Interface User Experience
There are many different operating systems out there like Google’s
Android, Apple’s iOS, Microsoft ‘s Windows Phone OS, Nokia ‘s Symbian,
Blackberry’s OS, Samsung’s BADA, WebOS and HP. The devices these OS’ run
on all have many different screen sizes. Each platform has a different user
interaction experience and two main platforms out there would be Android
and iOS; both of them have a different user experience. It is emphasised to
programmers that they should follow each platforms various rules and
guidelines, especially with iOS [19]. The mobile user interface is very
different to that of the desktop and some companies (like Microsoft) tried to
merge the experience with the Windows Metro GUI (Graphical User
Interface) which was released in Windows 8, they quickly realised this was a
7
mistake after the public backlash and so they rolled back to the classic look
for Windows 10. Many users like the distinction between the desktop and the
mobile interface. Native applications always provide the highest level of
native user experience because it’s compiled to native code for the platform
that is being used on. As described in earlier sections there are frameworks
that fully achieve a native look for applications, a few of the examples would
be Titanium and Applause. There are others which do not fully achieve native
the native look, like PhoneGap and AngularJS but they use various libraries
to achieve more of a native look, libraries such as Xui, JQyeryMobile, Sencha
Touch, JQTouch and WebApp.net. According to results produced by paper
[20] a sufficient level of native user interface can be obtained if an
appropriate framework is picked to develop an application.
9. Conclusion
“Write once run anywhere” [3] is a principal that was coined by Sun
Microsystems when they were developing java, which is exactly the same as
what all of these frameworks are trying to achieve. We still see heterogeneity
within cross platform development as it is split into four groups as described
earlier on. We see some categories gaining huge popularity and being
adopted by the community very well, like web applications with HTML5
allowing developers to use the phones hardware. With popular web
application frameworks like AngularJS maintained by Google and as part of a
bigger bundle with the MEAN Stack and with the new release of JavaScript’s
ECMAScript standard 6 it will make it more usable, robust and will add extra
capabilities. While some other frameworks such as Applause came into
existence and didn’t gain much interest or popularity and not much
development is being done as agreed by the developers from the Applause
development team referenced in following paper [13]. So what we see here
is a lot of development in Cross-Platform frameworks with some of them
aiming at big markets like Android and iOS and others trying to cover all the
operating systems. The number of different types of mobile devices keeps
increasing and with the rise of IoT (internet of things) more and more devices
are getting connected to the Internet, which leads to an exponential curve,
meaning more platforms and more cross platform development.
